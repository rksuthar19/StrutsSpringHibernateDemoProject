To debug application you have to follow two steps-
1st tell server to deploy in debug mode
here in this example i have specified following instruction
                <jvmarg value="-Xdebug"/>
                <jvmarg value="-Xnoagent"/>
                <jvmarg value="-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=5556,server=y,suspend=y"/>
            in build.xml
which inform jvm to run application in debug mode.

2nd step is not i have to tell my IDE to specify codebase to debug on port on which debug
so select edit run debug configuration
select remote option and specify host-localhost
and port-5556 whih you have mentioned in jvmargument

that's all done
